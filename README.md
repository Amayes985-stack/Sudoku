# Sudoku
In this project, I've decided to use my knowledge in the x86 assembly language to build a Sudoku game .

A desktop Sudoku game built with Assembly programming language.

The main and only folder in this repository is "Assembly_project" which is a visual studio project having the project source code under "main.asm" file.
